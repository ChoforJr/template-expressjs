Template for my Express JS projects

# Author : FORSAKANG CHOFOR JUNIOR

# Don't Forget to Create a .env file And put the connection string in it;

connectionString: "postgresql://<role_name>:<role_password>@localhost:5432/<database>"
example: DATABASE_URL="postgresql://chofor:chofor@localhost:5432/game_shop"

# Don't forget this is a template;

Meaning you will have to make some editing for you
use case and also make changes to files like populatedb.js and cleardb.js to
match you database and you use case.
